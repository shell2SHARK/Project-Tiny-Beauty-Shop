Tiny Beauty Shop (or TBS) is a Top Down simulation game where the player must buy new clothes for his avatar in a store.

Each outfit has a unique look and can be equipped in real-time within the avatar.

This game is just a prototype to show my skills as a game developer. All codes and assets (except audios and NPC expressions) was made by me.
